# Deamer Project

## Welcome!

Deamer Project is a Cross-Platform Language and Ecosystem Generation Toolchain.

Inside Deamer you find Tooling, Extensions, and DSLs allowing you to deeply express your language.
Deamer understands what you express using its Language Definition System, this allows Deamer to generate and maintain Great Compilers and Ecosystems for your language.

Deamer Ecosystem Generation gives a lot of possibilities for your Language Ecosystem, examples:

- Syntax Highlighter Generation for various IDEs and Text Editors
- Language Documentation Generation
- Generation of UML Class Diagram Reverse Engineering Tooling
- And more

## Examples and Tutorials

For Examples and Tutorials go to the Example Repo: "https://github.com/Deruago/DeamerExamples"

## Documentation

For documentation about the project see the Documentation Repo: "https://github.com/Deruago/DeamerDocumentation";

## Quick Start Guide

Clone the Repo and Run the Installer, for linux:

```bash
git clone --recursive https://github.com/Deruago/theDeamerProject.git
cd theDeamerProject
sudo python3 ./installer.py
```

For Windows:

```bash
git clone --recursive https://github.com/Deruago/theDeamerProject.git
cd theDeamerProject
python3 ./installer.py
```

More information about installation can be found at: "[How To Install Deamer?](https://github.com/Deruago/theDeamerProject#how-to-install-deamer)".

To start up generating compilers and ecosystems, it is highly recommended to visit the example repo: https://github.com/Deruago/DeamerExamples.

## Compiler Generation capabilities

- Compilers can be generated that may utilize different parsers:
    - Dparse
        - LALR
        - LR
        - GLR
        - GLALR
        - Recursive Descent
    - Antlr4
        - ALL(*)
    - Bison
        - LALR
        - LR
        - GLR
- AST and CST construction
- Semantic modeling
    - File/Module Import
    - Trivial value representation
- Concept modeling
    - Comments
    - OOP Syntactic concepts
- Ecosystem tooling

## Getting the Deamer Source Code

Run the ```git clone``` command on this repo:

```bash
git clone --recursive https://github.com/Deruago/theDeamerProject.git
```

The above will retrieve the Deamer source code and its dependencies, so that you can easily install it.



## How To Install Deamer

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

- CMake
- Python
- C++ Compiler (Compatible with C++17)

### Installing

To quickly get started with Deamer Project. Run the Installer. The installer automates the installing of all projects in Deamer.

To run the installer simply do (for linux):

```bash
sudo python3 ./installer.py
```

And for Windows users run the python installer as adminstrator:

```bash
python3 .\installer.py
```



### Installing extensions

The installer will only install the neccessary development tools for languages, this excludes optional extensions such as DST. In order to install the full project add the flag ```-complete```:

```bash
sudo python3 ./installer.py -complete
```



### Installing without installer

If you want to install it without the helpers, you can do so by going to each project and following its install instructions.
